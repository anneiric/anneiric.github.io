        i really wanted to kiss you that day. the fumes of your copper coated
        cigarette were rising up out of your chest, into the air, as we stared
        at the swirls deforming the bleeding sunset. if i shut my eyes hard
        enough, i could taste your lips, red, with an unforgiving sweetness,
        like a thousand bursting berries on virgin taste buds.
      </p>
      <p>
        as your teeth fumbled with the lighter, i told you about marx and
        monique wittig. i made a joke about seizing the means of production and
        you grabbed my chin, chuckling.
      </p>
      <p>"look at me"</p>
      <p>
        i looked at you and i looked at you and i looked at you. i looked at
        your swan neck that gave rise to a soft jaw. i looked at the ocean salt
        tessellating your cheeks. i looked at your eyes, with emerald, pearled
        tears of alcoholic insomnia. i looked at the mole beside your eyebrow,
        bleached by the tesco concealer we bought at 3am, and i saw that you
        would rip the sky in two for me as hades would for persephone. the gods
        in the heavens above us rumbled with laugher. laugher because hades
        ruined persephone - and we too; the two lesbian lovers with an ambrosia
        and nicotine addiction.
      </p>
      <p>"do you know what the universe tastes like?" you asked me.</p>
      <p>"nothing?”</p>
      <p>
        “no, not nothing;" you flicked your eyes at our hands; to the faint
        shape of a bathtub that we stick and poked and whispered, "rum and
        raspberries.”
      </p>
      <p>“this has to be made up,” i scoffed.</p>
      <p>
        “it’s not!” you grinned. i loved your smile. “there’s a dust cloud in
        the centre of the universe that is primarily made of a chemical called
        ethyl formate. it’s the same chemical that gives flavour to raspberries
        and scent to rum.”
      </p>
      <p>
        i told you that i loved you, when i sat on your counter in low spongebob
        socks and picked at the skin of my banana. you were drunk then. and you
        probably didn't remember it when you woke up behind the couch with a
        pink bandage on your knee.
      </p>
      <p>
        it's ok though. every time i kiss a new girl, i remember your taste. rum
        and raspberries.
